Cross-platform scripting language

Goals
=====

- Bash, powershell or batch runners (download intpreter)
- Cross-Platform Interpreter (Windows, RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, MacOS)
- Based on typescript but using C style scoping.

Stretch Goals
=============
- Scripts / Libraries must provide a set of tests that can be run cross-platform.
- Scripts / Libraries fall into categories depending on their status (platform dependant (only supported on a single platform), cross-platform (supported on all platforms))
- Dependencies are automatically downloaded at run-time (or can have all their dependencies installed beforehand).

Components
==========
- Language specification
- Intepreter
- Registry
- Core Libraries
